                            In the world we live in, there's no shortage of amazing people that 
                            create advancements in technology by taking on many of the challenges
                            that we face today. They come up with solutions and inventions that help
                            shape our lives. The Marvel Universe is no different. We see many scientists, 
                            physicists, roboticists, and more that are aided in their adventures by their powers
                            and also their wit and ingenuity. 
                            We know of our classic heros Iron Man, Bruce Banner, and Hank Pym, however there are 
                            up and coming heros that are carving out their own paths. 
                            Riri WIlliams(Iron Heart), Kamala Khan(Ms. Marvel), Lunella Lafayette(Moon Girl), Amadeus Cho(Brawn), and Miles Morales(Spider Man) are some 
                            of the new generation of heros that have stepped on the scene. There's also one more budding light that will soon shine. 
                            There's also one more budding light that will soon shine.(Did we already say that???) These upstarts 
                            might be young but they are prodigies, bright and brilliant. We will go on a jounrey together
                            with them to create, learn, write, build and grow. Let's take on the challenge! 
                            <!-- Its hard not to notice the green giant, The Hulk, but when 
                            he's chilled out Ph.D Bruce Banner is one of the world's leading scientists in nuclear physics.
                            Think about some of the most powerful animals you know, lions, tigers, and bears, oh my! Have you 
                            ever considered the ant. Hank Pym, American entomologist and biochemist, has changed the way we look at the small insect 
                            by creating his famous Pym Particles, subatomic particles which can increase or decrease the size and mass of objects or living beings.
                            Last but not least, we have the Armored Avenger himself, the genius, billionaire, philantropist, Tony Stark. Tony Stark 
                            is a prodigy that through his intellict and determination invented the iconic and cutting-edge armor becoming, Iron Man. 
                            We know all too well of our classic heros, however there are many young heroes that are creating a bright future. -->

                            Ok, I don't mean the type of lab where you mix a bunch of chemicals together and something explodes, at 
                            least not yet! Have you ever wanted to go to class with your favorite hero. On top of that how about
                            wanting to code your own artificial intelligence like Jarvis or Friday. Or just figure out 
                            all the things you can invent with the different types of engineering and software we have 
                            available today. Well, your in the right class. Here in the lab, you will get introduced to some of the 
                            areas of study that helped our heros at Marvel become who they are. You will learn about what engineering is 
                            and the many things we create with it, software engineering and how we use coding, and one of my newly personally 
                            favorites, Robotics. But, I won't promise any Iron Man armour. Not while the teachers, watching!

                            Marvel +Stem is not only about education and learning. It is also about writing and storytelling.
                            One of the best ways we can take in and retain information is through telling a story, and we have
                            an <u>ALL NEW</u> story where we follow one of our newest and brightest characters. You 
                            will follow them in a journey of invention, discovery, exploration, and pushing limits. Remember hindsight is 20/20.
                            Let's have some fun!
